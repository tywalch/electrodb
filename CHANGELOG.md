# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Breaking changes to feature functionality will trigger a new Major Version increase. Significant feature improvements and major bug fixes will trigger Minor Version increases. Small, maintenance and additive changes will trigger Patch Version increases.     

## [Unreleased]
## Changing
- Bulk Operations to return the original object passed to the operation if that object was returned by DynamoDB as unprocessed.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-06-27
### Added
- new `.match()` method to replace original Find method functionality. [[read more]](./README.md#match-records)
- New `template` property on Model for building custom composite key templates. The `template` property also brings forward a new syntax similar to template literal syntax. [[read more]](./README.md#composite-attribute-templates)
- New custom composite key syntax using the `template` property. [[read more]](./README.md#composite-attribute-templates)
- Numeric table keys now possible. Before PK and SK values could only be strings, Numeric Keys are now supported through the `templates` index property. [[read more]](./README.md#numeric-keys) 

### Changed
- Rename of `facets` property on Model to `composite` for arrays and `template` for string templates. [[read more]](./README.md#the-renaming-of-index-property-facets-to-composite-and-template) 
- Get method now returns `null` when value is not found. Prior functionality returned an empty object. [[read more]](./README.md#get-record)
- Strict enforcement of all SK composite attributes being present when performing `.get()`, `.put()`, `.create()`, `.delete()`, `.remove()`, `.update()`, `.patch()` operations.
- Find method now does not add filters for values supplied, Find now only identifies an Index (if possible) and fulfills the Composite Attributes of that Index (if possible). [[read more]](./README.md#find-records)
- Query Option `lastEvaluatedKeyRaw` when used with _pagination_ replaced Query Option `pager` with option values: `"raw"`, `"item"`, `"named"`. Default set to `"named"`. [[read more]](./README.md#pager-query-options)  
- Query Option `lastEvaluatedKeyRaw` when used with _bulk operations_ replaced Query Option `unprocessed` with option values: `"raw"`, `"item"`. Default set to `"item"`. [[read more]](./README.md#query-options)

### Deprecated
- Removing `facets` property from documentation, examples, and TypeScript typing. Replaced with `composite` property for arrays and `template` for string templates. [[read more]](./README.md#facets)
- Fully deprecated custom facet string format. Facet strings defined attributes with a prefixed `:` as in `:storeId` would resolve to `storeId`. This has been replaced by the `template` syntax, surrounding the attribute with `${...}`. [[read more]](./README.md#composite-attribute-templates)
  
## [1.1.0] - 2021-07-07
### Added
- Expanding "collection" concept to include sub-collections. Sub-collections will allow for more precise cross-entity queries to be modeled. [[read more]](./README.md#sub-collections) 

### Fixed
- Addressed edge-case when modeling sparse indexes that would leave unable to be queried via secondary index. [[read more]](./RELEASE.md#fix-sparse-index-edge-case)

## [1.1.1] - 2021-07-07
### Added
- Added new syntax for Attribute Property `watch` to trigger whenever any attribute is updated/retrieved. [[read more]](./README.md#attribute-watching-watch-all)

### Changed
- The Attribute Property `readOnly` is now enforced _before_ `watch` properties are evaluated. This allows properties that use the Attribute Property `watch` to deliberately circumnavigate `readOnly` enforcement. [[read more]](./README.md#createdat-and-updatedat-attributes)
  
## [1.2.0] - 2021-07-31
### Added
- Added new update methods `append`, `add`, `subtract`, `data`, `remove`, `delete`, and `data` for improved support of all DynamoDB update methods. [[read more]](./README.md#update-record)

### Changed
- The property names of `ExpressionAttributeValues` underwent some change in this release due to the addition of new update operations. This is not a breaking change but if you have tests to match on the exact params returned from ElectroDB these will likely break. [[read more]](./RELEASE.md#expressionattributevalues-properties)
  
## [1.3.0] - 2021-08-09
### Added
- New Attribute types `map`, `list`, `set`. [[read more]](./README.md#expanded-syntax)
- New Query Options, and support for, `ReturnValues` as requested in Issue#71. [[read more]](./README.md#query-options) 
- New type definitions for recently released update methods `append`, `add`, `subtract`, `data`, `remove`, and `delete`. [[read more]](./README.md#exported-types) 

### Changed
- Attributes that have been flagged as `required` are now not possible to be removed (using the update method `remove()`) from a stored Item. This was an oversight from the last release.
- Attributes that have been flagged as `hidden` now skips invoking that attribute's getter method.  

### Fixed
- Issues that prevented the nesting of update `value()` operation.
- TypeScript type definitions for `get()` method now incorporate potential for `null` response.
- Type definitions for `value()` and `name()` where clause operations.  

## [1.3.1] - 2021-08-09
### Added
- New entity method `parse()` to expose ElectroDB formatting for values retrieved outside of ElectroDB. [[read more]](./README.md#parse)

## [1.3.2] - 2021-08-11
### Fixed
- Newly added method `parse()` had critical typo. Method now has an improved api, and appropriate tests [[read more]](./README.md#parse)

## [1.4.0] - 2021-08-22
### Added 
- Added support for choosing the case ElectroDB will use when modeling a Partition or Sort Key. [[read more]](./README.md#using-electrodb-with-existing-data)
- Added support for indexes to use fields that are shared with attribute fields. This should help users leverage ElectroDB with existing tables. [[read more]](./README.md#using-electrodb-with-existing-data)
- Added Query Option `ignoreOwnership` to bypass ElectroDB checks/interrogations for ownership of an item before returning it. [[read more]](./README.md#query-options)

## [1.4.1] - 2021-08-25
### Added
- Typedef support for RegExp validation on string attributes

### Fixed
- RegExp validation issue resulting in undefined (but not required) values being tested.

## [1.4.2] - 2021-09-09
### Fixed
- Typing for `.page()` method pager. Now includes the destructured keys associated with the index being queried. [[read more]](./README.md#page)
- Adding documentation, and expanding typing for the query option `limit`, for use in `.params()` calls. [[read more]](./README.md#query-options)

## [1.4.3] - 2021-10-03
### Fixed
- ElectroDB would throw when an `undefined` property was passed to query. This has been changed to not throw if a partial query on that index can be accomplished with the data provided.

## [1.4.4] - 2021-10-16
### Added
- Updates did not include composite attributes involved in primary index. Though these values cannot be changed, they should be `set` on update method calls in case the update results in an item insert. [[read more]](./README.md#updates-to-composite-attributes)

## [0.11.1] - 2021-10-17
### Patched
- Updates did not include composite attributes involved in primary index. Though these values cannot be changed, they should be `set` on update method calls in case the update results in an item insert. [[read more]](./README.md#updates-to-composite-attributes)

## [1.4.5] - 2021-10-17
### Fixed
- Improved .npmignore to remove playground oriented files, and created official directory to keep playground in sync with library changes.

## [1.4.6] - 2021-10-20
### Added, Fixed
- Adding Entity identifiers to all update operations. When primary index composite attributes were added in 1.4.4, entities were written properly but did not include the identifiers. This resulted in entities being written but not being readable without the query option `ignoreOwnership` being used.

## [1.4.7] - 2021-10-20
### Changed
- Using `add()` update mutation now resolves to `ADD #prop :prop` update expression instead of a `SET #prop = #prop + :prop`

### Fixed
- Fixed param naming conflict during updates, when map attribute shares a name with another (separate) attribute.

## [1.4.8] - 2021-11-01
### Fixed
- Addressed issue#90 to flip batchGet's response tuple type definition.

## [1.5.0] - 2021-11-07
### Changed
- Queries will now fully paginate all responses. Prior to this change, ElectroDB would only return items from a single ElectroDB query result. Now ElectroDB will paginate through all query results. This will impact both uses of entity queries and service collections. [[read more](./README.md#query-method)]
- The query option `limit` has an extended meaning with the change to automatically paginate records on query. The option `limit` now represents a target for the number of items to return from DynamoDB. If this option is passed, Queries on entities and through collections will paginate DynamoDB until this limit is reached or all items for that query have been returned. [[read more](./README.md#query-options)]

### Added
- A new query option `pages` has been added to coincide with the change to automatically paginate all records when queried. The `pages` option sets a max number of pagination iterations ElectroDB will perform on a query. When this option is paired with `limit`, ElectroDB will respect the first condition reached. [[read more](./README.md#query-options)]

## [1.6.0] - 2021-11-21
### Added
- Exporting TypeScript interfaces for `ElectroError` and `ElectroValidationError`
- Errors thrown within an attribute's validate callback are now wrapped and accessible after being thrown. Prior to this change, only the `message` of the error thrown by a validation function was persisted back through to the user, now the error itself is also accessible. Reference the exported interface typedef for `ElectroValidationError` [here](./index.d.ts) to see the new properties available on a thrown validation error.

### Changed
- As a byproduct of enhancing validation errors, the format of message text on a validation error has changed. This could be breaking if your app had a hardcoded dependency on the exact text of a thrown validation error.

### Fixed
- For Set attributes, the callback functions `get`, `set`, and `validate` are now consistently given an Array of values. These functions would sometimes (incorrectly) be called with a DynamoDB DocClient Set.

## [1.6.1] - 2021-12-05
### Fixed
- In some cases the `find()` and `match()` methods would incorrectly select an index without a complete partition key. This would result in validation exceptions preventing the user from querying if an index definition and provided attribute object aligned improperly. This was fixed and a slightly more robust mechanism for ranking indexes was made.

## [1.6.2] - 2022-01-27
### Changed
- The methods `create`, `patch`, and `remove` will now refer to primary table keys through parameters via ExpressionAttributeNames when using `attribute_exists()`/`attribute_not_exists()` DynamoDB conditions. Prior to this they were referenced directly which would fail in cases where key names include illegal characters. Parameter implementation change only, non-breaking.

## [1.6.3] - 2022-02-22
### Added
- Add `data` update operation `ifNotExists` to allow for use of the UpdateExpression function "if_not_exists()".

## [1.7.0] - 2022-03-13
### Added
- New feature: "Listeners". Listeners open the door to some really cool tooling that was not possible because of how ElectroDB augments raw DynamoDB responses and did not provide easy access to raw DyanmoDB parameters. [[read more](./README.md#listeners)]

## [1.7.1] - 2022-03-19
### Added
- Adding support for the v3 DyanmoDBClient. This change also brings in a new ElectroDB dependency [@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb). [[read more](./README.md#aws-dynamodb-client)]

## [1.7.2] - 2022-03-27
### Fixed
- Fixed issue#111, `update` method specific query option typing no longer lost when using a `where` method in a query chain
- Fixing incorrect typing for exposed `UpdateEntityItem` type. Exported type was missing composite key attributes

## [1.8.0] - 2022-03-28
### Added
- Expected typings for the injected v2 client now include methods for `transactWrite` and `transactGet`
### Changed
- Map attributes will now always resolve to least an empty object on a `create` and `put` methods (instead of just the root map)
- In the past, default values for property attributes on maps only resolves when a user provided an object to place the values on. Now default values within maps attributes will now always resolve onto the object on `create` and `put` methods.

## [1.8.1] - 2022-03-29
### Fixed
- Solidifying default application methodology: default values for nested properties will be applied up until an undefined default occurs or default callback returns undefined

## [1.8.2] - 2022-05-13
### Fixed
- Issue impacting the successful propagation loggers and listeners from a Service definition to Entity children

## [1.8.3] - 2022-05-14
### Changed
- Removing validation that requires at least one attribute to be provided in a PK composite. This opens the door to static PKs if the user so chooses

## [1.8.4] - 2022-05-18
### Changed
- Removing validation that an attribute used for one index cannot be used by another. ElectroDB will now simply validate that all composite attributes associated with an indexed field are identical, and that a field is not used as both a PK and SK in separate indexes. This change allows for LSIs to be used with ElectroDB

## [1.9.0] - 2022-06-18
### Added
- Add new batchGet query option, `preserveBatchOrder`, which will ensure the order returned by a batchGet will be the same as the order provided. [[read more](./README.md#query-options)]

## [1.10.0] - 2022-06-29
### Fixed
- TypeScript 4.7 introduced changes that caused type inference issues with the Entity, Service, and exposed types. A re-vamp of some typing was done to rectify these issues, new tests and existing tests were made work with the latest versions of TypeScript and tsd.
### Changed
- Project now is more deliberate about the types exposed via the package. This is because I have moved away from a single type definition file (which by default exports all types). If you had a dependency on a type that used to be exposed, open a ticket and I can expose it. In the future exposed types will be the only types officially supported by semver.

## [1.10.1] - 2022-06-30
### Fixed
- Exported additional types

## [1.10.2] - 2022-07-02
### Fixed
- Reorganizing type definition files into single file again to appease the frontend dependency overlords in https://electrodb.fun

## [1.11.0] - 2022-07-04
### Added
- Adding support for "ProjectionExpressions" via the Query Option: `attributes` [[read more](./README#query-options)]

## [1.11.1] - 2022-07-06
### Fixed
- Sort keys for queries will now match on equality when all sort key composite attributes are provided in full. Prior to this release, ElectroDB would use `begins_with(...)` which could potentially result in data leakages if a sort key's value was the starting prefix to another sort key value. [[read more](./README.md#begins-with-queries)]

## [1.12.0] - 2022-08-11
### Added
- Added support for attribute types "enum string set" and "enum number set". This will allow users to defined a finite list of values (strings or numbers ) supported for a set [[read more](./README#set-attributes)]
- TypeScript support for "Custom Attributes", bring your own types to express complex attributes. [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#custom-attributes)]

## [2.0.0] - 2022-09-19 [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#version-2-migration)]
### Added
- Additional exported exported types to match new response structures. [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#custom-attributes)]
### Changed
- Changing response structure on all methods to be an object with query results on a `data` property. [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#version-2-migration)]
- Pagination is now performed via the `.go()` terminal method, and the LastEvaluatedKey is now returned a string `cursor`.  [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#cursor-pagination)]
- The `go()` terminal method now only queries one page by default. To auto-page (to match functionality prior to this change), pass the query option `pages` with a value of `'all'`. [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#unified-pagination-apis)]
### Deprecated
- The boolean query option `raw` and `returnKeys` have been deprecated (still accepted for the time being) and replaced with the query option `data`, which accepts the values `'raw'`, `'includeKeys'`, `'attributes'` or `undefined`.
### Removed
- `.page()` terminal method. All pagination is now done through the `.go()` method. Queries and scans now return a `cursor` property (of type "string") to be passed on subsequent pagination requests. [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#unified-pagination-apis)]

## [2.1.0] - 2022-10-02
### Added
- Added a new attribute property `padding` to aid with zero padding patterns. [[read more](#attribute-definition)]

## [2.1.1] - 2022-10-09
### Fixed
- Defect with sort key composition that would treat falsely values as absent attributes.

## [2.1.2] - 2022-10-16
### Added
- Now exporting `ElectroValidationError` and `ElectroError` as classes so they can be more easily interrogated/triaged by user error handling.
### Fixed
- On `update` and `patch` operations, the `data` method did not properly apply mutation constraints for `required` and `readOnly`. Data will now correctly throw in a similar manor the to individual mutation methods.

## [2.2.0] - 2022-10-31
### Added
- A BIG addition to the library: Clustered Indexes. Clustered indexes allow for Collections to be composed of more similar, homogenous data.
- The addition of new Entity and Service methods: `setTableName`, `getTableName`, `setClient`, `getClient`.

## [2.2.1] - 2022-11-02
### Fixed
- Addressed github issue #144, root map attributes would set an empty object regardless if the user supplied it.

## [2.2.2] - 2022-11-04
### Added
- (since rolled back) ~The return type from an update/patch call now returns an Entity item when `all_new` or `all_old` response options are passed~

## [2.2.3] - 2022-11-05
### Removed
- Backed out the response typing change added in `2.2.2`. The type of a record coming back from an update is more complex than one might expect. Because update operations can result in a record insert, the response type is not necessarily a TableItem. I am backing out this change for now until I can be be more sure of an appropriate typing.
### Added
- New function to help with Custom Types: CustomAttributeType. This replaces `createCustomAttribute` (now depreciated) because of the unfortunate widening caused by the initial implementation. [[read more](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/blob/master/README.md#custom-attributes))]
### Deprecated
- The function `createCustomAttribute` is now deprecated. The function still operates as it did, though any changes related to Custom Attribute types will see development focused on `CustomAttributeType` rather than this function.

## [2.2.4] - 2022-11-06
### Fixed
- Addressed issue#162: attribute validation functions were not invoked when updating through the `data` method.
- Conditional filters can now be added to `get` operations. DynamoDB `get` does not allow for filtering but the TransactWrite/TransactGet methods allow for `ConditionCheck` which is essentially `get` + `conditions`.

## [2.2.5] - 2022-11-09
### Fixed
- Addressed [issue#172](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/issues/172), where clause mishandling of nested attribute references

## [2.2.6] - 2022-11-10
### Fixed
- Addressed issue where scans would incorrectly accumulate filters across usages

## [2.3.0] - 2022-11-22
### Added
- Adding new update method: `upsert`. Upsert is similar to `put` in that it will create a record if one does not exist, except `upsert` perform an update if that record already exists.

## [2.3.1] - 2022-11-23
### Fixed
- Address issue#179, the query option `table` was not correctly propagated, resulting a failure for that declared the table name was "missing"

## [2.3.2] - 2022-11-23
### Fixed
- Upsert method would silently disregard `where` clause usage, and would not add condition expression to parameters.

## [2.3.3] - 2022-11-28
### Fixed
- Issue #182: Addressed inconsistency with `remove` and `delete` functionality between `update` and `patch` methods.

## [2.3.4] - 2022-12-17
### Milestone
- First code contribution by user @NoahDavey (via [PR-197](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/pull/197)). Fixes boolean evaluation during upsert

## [2.3.5] - 2022-12-18
### Fixed
- Fixes issue that resulted in provided undefined values from becoming involuntarily set via updates
- Updated documentation links in error message to direct traffic to https://electrodb.dev

## [2.4.0] - 2022-01-19
### Added
- Adds the new filter expression methods: `size()`, `type()` and `escape`. Addresses Issue#208 [[read more]](https://electrodb.dev/en/queries/filters/#operations)
- Adds the `createSchema()` function for helping create and type ElectroDB schemas without instantiating an Entity. Addresses Issue#167. [[read more]](https://electrodb.dev/en/reference/typscript/#createSchema)

## [2.4.1] - 2023-01-20
### Fixed
- Recently added `createSchema()` function would validate but not return the schema object provided

## [2.4.2] - 2023-03-03
### Fixed
- Restores `ignoreOwnership` execution option. Addresses [issue #194](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb/issues/194) which calls out regression with `ignoreOwnership`. This flag is now appropriately applied to "query", "get", and "scan" operations.

## [2.5.0] - 2023-03-19
### Added
- Adds transaction functionality: `get` and `write` transactions are now supported in ElectroDB via [transact write](https://electrodb.dev/en/mutations/transact-write) and [transact get](https://electrodb.dev/en/queries/transact-get) methods.

## [2.5.1] - 2023-03-22
### Fixed 
- The previous version exported typings directly from the AWS dynamodb client package which, because it was so large, caused the playground to take a massive performance hit. Instead, the library now expose a simplistic version of those types instead.

## [2.6.0] - 2023-05-22
### Added
- Adds new query execution option `hydrate`. When a GSI uses a `KEYS_ONLY` projection, the `hydrate` option will perform the query and then a subsequent `batchGet` to "hydrate" the results.

### Changed
- The execution option `limit` is now better optimized for cases where filters might result in index "misses". The `limit` option used to use the `Limit` parameter, but this could result in requiring more requests when user applied filters caused no items from being returned in a single request.   

### Fixed
- A common issue amongst new users, was unexpected errors when using a terminal method twice on a query chain. This would often come up when a user called `.params()` to log out parameters and then call `.go()` on the same chain. The fix was to prevent duplicative side effects from occurring on each subsequent terminal method call. Addresses gh issue #239.
