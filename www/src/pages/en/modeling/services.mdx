In **_ElectroDB_** a `Service` represents a collection of related Entities. Services allow you to build queries that span across Entities. Similar to Entities, Services can coexist on a single table without collision. You can use Entities independent of Services, and you do not need to import models into a Service to use them individually. However, you do need to use a Service if you intend to make queries that "join" multiple Entities.

## Creation

The property name you assign the entity will become the "alias" by which you can reference the entity through the Service. Aliases can be useful if you are building a service with multiple versions of the same entity, or if you wish to change the reference name of an entity without impacting the schema/key names of that entity.

```typescript
import { Service } from "electrodb";

const TaskApp = new Service(
  {
    employee: Employee, // available at TaskApp.entities.employee
    task: Task, // available at TaskApp.entities.task
  },
  { table, client },
);
```

As with Entities, Services take an _optional_ second parameter that allows you to specify a `client` and `table`. Using this constructor interface, the Service will inherit these values from its entities, if they were provided. Values passed directly to the Service will override the `client` or `table` values on the individual entities.

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| table    | The name of the DynamoDB table in AWS.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| client   | (optional) An instance of `DynamoDBClient` from the `aws-sdk` to be used when querying a DynamoDB table. This is optional if you only wish to use the `params` functionality, or if you intend to provide the client dynamically at query time via [execution options](/en/core-concepts/executing-queries#execution-options). |

## Validation

When joining an Entity to a Service, ElectroDB will perform several validations to ensure the provided Entities are consistently defined. The following is a list of the validations performed on Service creation:

- [Entity](/en/modeling/entities) names must be unique across a Service.
- [Collection](/en/modeling/collections) names must be unique across a Service.
- All [Collections](/en/modeling/collections) map to the same DynamoDB indexes with the same index field names. See [Indexes](/en/modeling/indexes).
- Partition Key [Composite Attributes](#composite attribute-arrays) on a [Collection](/en/modeling/collections) must have the same attribute names and labels (if applicable). See [Attribute Definitions](/en/modeling/attributes#attribute-definition).
- The [name of the Service in the Model](/en/modeling/entity#entity-definition-schema) must match the Name defined on the [Service](/en/modeling/services) instance.
- If the attributes of an Entity have overlapping names with other attributes in that service, they must all have compatible or matching [attribute definitions](/en/modeling/attributes#attribute-definition).
