Execution options can be added the `.params()` and `.go()` to change query behavior or add customer parameters to a query.

By default, **ElectroDB** enables you to work with records as the names and properties defined in the model. Additionally, it removes the need to deal directly with the docClient parameters which can be complex for a team without as much experience with DynamoDB. The Query Options object can be passed to both the `.params()` and `.go()` methods when building you query. Below are the options available:

```typescript
{
  client?: DocumentClient;
  params?: object;
  table?: string;
  data?: 'raw' | 'includeKeys' | 'attributes';
  originalErr?: boolean;
  concurrent?: number;
  unprocessed?: "raw" | "item";
  response?: "default" | "none" | "all_old" | "updated_old" | "all_new" | "updated_new";;
  logger?: (event) => void;
  listeners Array<(event) => void>;
  attributes?: string[];
  consistent?: boolean;
};
```

| Option      |       Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | :------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| client      | _(from constructor)_ | Provide a DynamoDB client dynamically at query execution time. This allows per-request client selection without modifying the Entity or Service instance. The client provided here takes precedence over any client set at instantiation time. Both v2 and v3 AWS SDK clients are supported and will be auto-detected.                                                                       |
| params      |         `{}`         | Properties added to this object will be merged onto the params sent to the document client. Any conflicts with **ElectroDB** will favor the params specified here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| table       | _(from constructor)_ | Use a different table than the one defined in the [Service Options](#service-options)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| attributes  |  _(all attributes)_  | The `attributes` query option allows you to specify ProjectionExpression Attributes for your `get` or `query` operation. As of `1.11.0` only root attributes are allowed to be specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| data        |    `"attributes"`    | Accepts the values `'raw'`, `'includeKeys'`, `'attributes'` or `undefined`. Use `'raw'` to return query results as they were returned by the docClient. Use `'includeKeys'` to include item partition and sort key values in your return object. By default, **ElectroDB** does not return partition, sort, or global keys in its response.                                                   |
| originalErr |       `false`        | By default, **ElectroDB** alters the stacktrace of any exceptions thrown by the DynamoDB client to give better visibility to the developer. Set this value equal to `true` to turn off this functionality and return the error unchanged.                                                                                                                                                     |
| concurrent  |         `1`          | When performing batch operations, how many requests (1 batch operation == 1 request) to DynamoDB should ElectroDB make at one time. Be mindful of your DynamoDB throughput configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| unprocessed |       `"item"`       | Used in batch processing to override ElectroDBs default behaviour to break apart DynamoDBs `Unprocessed` records into composite attributes. See more detail about this in the sections for [BatchGet](#batch-get), [BatchDelete](#batch-write-delete-records), and [BatchPut](#batch-write-put-records).                                                                                      |
| response    |     `"default"`      | Used as a convenience for applying the DynamoDB parameter `ReturnValues`. The options here are the same as the parameter values for the DocumentClient except lowercase. The `"none"` option will cause the method to return null and will bypass ElectroDB's response formatting -- useful if formatting performance is a concern.                                                           |
| listeners   |         `[]`         | An array of callbacks that are invoked when [internal ElectroDB events](#events) occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| logger      |        _none_        | A convenience option for a single event listener that semantically can be used for logging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| consistent  |        _none_        | When set to `true`, DynamoDB will return the most up-to-date data reflecting updates from all prior write operations using DynamoDB's [`ConsistentRead`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html#HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.Strongly) parameter. Strongly consistent reads are only supported on tables and local secondary indexes. |
