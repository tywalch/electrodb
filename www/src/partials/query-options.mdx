Query options can be added the `.params()` and `.go()` to change query behavior or add customer parameters to a query.

By default, **ElectroDB** enables you to work with records as the names and properties defined in the model. Additionally, it removes the need to deal directly with the docClient parameters which can be complex for a team without as much experience with DynamoDB. The Query Options object can be passed to both the `.params()` and `.go()` methods when building you query. Below are the options available:

```typescript
{
  params?: object;
  table?: string;
  data?: 'raw' | 'includeKeys' | 'attributes';
  pager?: 'raw' | 'cursor';
  originalErr?: boolean;
  response?: "default" | "none" | "all_old" | "updated_old" | "all_new" | "updated_new";
  ignoreOwnership?: boolean;
  limit?: number;
  count?: number;
  pages?: number | 'all';
  logger?: (event) => void;
  listeners Array<(event) => void>;
  attributes?: string[];
  order?: 'asc' | 'desc';
  compare?: 'attributes' | 'keys' | 'v2';
  consistent?: boolean;
  projection?: 'all' | 'keys_only' | string[];
};
```

### Query Execution Options

### params
**Default Value:** `{}`
Properties added to this object will be merged onto the params sent to the document client. Any conflicts with **ElectroDB** will favor the params specified here. Consider this an escape hatch for options not yet supported by **ElectroDB**.

### table
**Default Value:** _(from constructor)_
Use a different table than the one defined in [Service Options](/en/modeling/service#options) and/or [Entity Options](/en/modeling/entity#entity-options).

### attributes
**Default Value:** _(all attributes)_
The `attributes` query option allows you to specify ProjectionExpression Attributes for your `get` or `query` operation.

### data
**Default Value:** `"attributes"`
Accepts the values `'raw'`, `'includeKeys'`, `'attributes'` or `undefined`. Use `'raw'` to return query results as they were returned by the docClient. Use `'includeKeys'` to include item partition and sort key values in your return object. By default, **ElectroDB** does not return partition, sort, or global keys in its response.

### originalErr
**Default Value:** `false`
By default, **ElectroDB** alters the stacktrace of any exceptions thrown by the DynamoDB client to give better visibility to the developer. Set this value equal to `true` to turn off this functionality and return the error unchanged.

### response
**Default Value:** `"default"`
Used as a convenience for applying the DynamoDB parameter `ReturnValues`. The options here are the same as the parameter values for the DocumentClient except lowercase. The `"none"` option will cause the method to return null and will bypass ElectroDB's response formatting -- useful if formatting performance is a concern.

### ignoreOwnership
**Default Value:** `false`
By default, **ElectroDB** interrogates items returned from a query for the presence of matching entity "identifiers". This helps to ensure other entities, or other versions of an entity, are filtered from your results. If you are using ElectroDB with an existing table/dataset you can turn off this feature by setting this property to `true`.

### limit
**Default Value:** _none_
Used a convenience wrapper for the DynamoDB parameter `Limit` [[read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html#DDB-Query-request-Limit)].

### count
**Default Value:** _none_
A target for the number of items to return from DynamoDB. If this option is passed, Queries on entities will paginate DynamoDB until the items found match the count is reached or all items for that query have been returned. It is important to understand that this option may result in ElectroDB making multiple calls to DynamoDB to satisfy the count. For this reason, you should also consider using the `pages` option to limit the number of requests (or "pages") made to DynamoDB.

### pages
**Default Value:** 1
How many DynamoDB pages should a query iterate through before stopping. To have ElectroDB automatically paginate through all results, pass the string value `'all'`.

### order
**Default Value:** 'asc'
Convenience option for `ScanIndexForward`, to the change the order of queries based on your index's Sort Key -- valid options include 'asc' and 'desc'. [[read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html)]

### listeners
**Default Value:** `[]`
An array of callbacks that are invoked when [internal ElectroDB events](#events) occur.

### logger
**Default Value:** _none_
A convenience option for a single event listener that semantically can be used for logging.

### compare
**Default Value:** 'keys'
When performing comparison queries (e.g. `gt`, `gte`, `lte`, `lt`, `between`) it is often necessary to add additional filters. Understanding how a comparison query will impact the items returned can be challenging due to the unintuitive nature of sorting and multi-composite attribute Sort Keys.

By default (`comparison: "keys"`), ElectroDB builds comparison queries without applying attribute filters. In this way, the query's comparison applies to the item's "keys". This approach gives you complete control of your indexes, though your query may return unexpected data if you are not careful with item sorting.

When set to `attributes`, the `comparison` option instructs ElectroDB to apply attribute filters on each Sort Key composite attribute provided. In this way, the query comparison applies to the item's "attributes."

### consistent
**Default Value:** _none_
When set to `true`, DynamoDB will return the most up-to-date data reflecting updates from all prior write operations using DynamoDB's [`ConsistentRead`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html#HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.Strongly) parameter. Strongly consistent reads are only supported on tables and local secondary indexes.

### projection
**Default Value:** 'all'
The `projection` option maps to the DynamoDB table index definition [Projection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Projection.html).
